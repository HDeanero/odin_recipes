         <h2>
            Steps
         </h2>

         <ol>
            <li>Trim the beef tenderloin of any silver skin or excess fat to ensure a smooth, even shape. Tie the tenderloin with butcher’s twine at 1-inch intervals to maintain a uniform cylindrical shape during cooking.
                Generously season all sides with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Let the beef sit at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes to ensure even cooking</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tbsp olive oil and 1 tbsp butter in a large skillet over high heat until smoking hot.
                Sear the beef on all sides, including the ends, for 1 to 2 minutes per side to develop a deep brown crust (about 6 to 8 minutes total). Avoid moving the beef too much to ensure a good crust.
                Remove the beef from the skillet and immediately brush with Dijon mustard while hot to enhance flavor adhesion. Set aside to cool completely (about 30 minutes). Remove the twine after cooling.</li>
            <li>Clean the mushrooms with a damp paper towel to remove dirt. Pulse them in a food processor in batches until finely chopped (almost a paste but not pureed). Alternatively, chop finely by hand.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet used for the beef, melt 2 tbsp butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic, cooking until softened (2 to 3 minutes).
                Add the chopped mushrooms and thyme. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes until the mushrooms release their moisture and it evaporates completely. The mixture should be dry and paste-like.
                (Optional) Deglaze with ¼ cup white wine or sherry, cooking until the liquid is fully absorbed (2 to 3 minutes).
                (Optional) Stir in 2 tbsp heavy cream for a richer texture. Season with 1 tsp salt and ½ tsp pepper.
                Spread the duxelles on a plate to cool completely (about 20 to 30 minutes).</li>
            <li>Lay a large piece of plastic wrap on a clean work surface. Arrange the prosciutto slices in a slightly overlapping rectangular pattern, large enough to fully encase the beef (about 12x16 inches).
                Spread the cooled duxelles evenly over the prosciutto, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges.</li>
            <li>Place the cooled beef tenderloin in the center of the duxelles-covered prosciutto. If desired, spread a thin layer of English mustard over the beef for extra flavor.
                Using the plastic wrap, lift and fold the prosciutto and duxelles over the beef, rolling tightly to encase it completely. Twist the ends of the plastic wrap like a candy wrapper to form a tight log.
                Refrigerate the wrapped beef for 30 to 60 minutes to firm up and hold its shape.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to a rectangle about 1/8-inch thick and large enough to fully encase the beef (about 12x16 inches). Trim any excess pastry for decorations, if desired.
                If the pastry is too warm, chill it briefly to make it easier to handle.</li>
            <li>Unwrap the chilled beef from the plastic wrap and place it in the center of the puff pastry.
                Fold the pastry over the beef, sealing the edges tightly by pressing or crimping. Trim any excess pastry to avoid thick layers.
                Place the wrapped beef seam-side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet. If desired, use pastry scraps to create decorative shapes (e.g., lattice or leaves) and attach them with egg wash.
                Brush the entire pastry with egg wash for a golden finish. Optionally, sprinkle with flaky sea salt.
                Refrigerate the assembled Wellington for at least 15 to 30 minutes to chill the pastry, ensuring it stays crisp during baking.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place a rack in the center of the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake the Wellington for 35–45 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crisp. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the beef:
            <ul>    
                <li>Rare: 120–125°F (49–52°C)</li>
                <li>Medium-rare: 130–135°F (54–57°C) (recommended)</li>
                <li>Medium: 140–145°F (60–63°C)</li>
            </ul>    
                The pastry should reach an internal temperature of at least 200°F (93°C) to ensure it’s fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Remove the Wellington from the oven and let it rest on a cooling rack for 10–15 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute and makes slicing easier.</li>
            <li>Using a sharp serrated knife, slice the Wellington into 1-inch thick portions. A gentle sawing motion prevents crushing the pastry.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with sides like roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a red wine reduction sauce. A simple green salad with vinaigrette complements the richness.</li>
